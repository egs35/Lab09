## Roles of Databases in Web Apps

Databases are integral to web applications for:

1. **Data Storage**: Persistent storage of various data types.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Efficient retrieval of specific data.
3. **Data Integrity**: Enforcing accuracy and consistency of data.
4. **Scalability**: Supporting growth by distributing and optimizing data.
5. **Concurrency Control**: Managing simultaneous data access.
6. **Data Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access.

## Importance of SQL Language

SQL is crucial in web development because it:

1. **Standardizes Queries**: Supported by most relational database systems.
2. **Facilitates Powerful Querying**: Enables efficient data retrieval.
3. **Supports Data Manipulation**: Allows CRUD operations on data.
4. **Defines Database Structure**: Specifies schema and constraints.
5. **Optimizes Performance**: Provides tools for query optimization.
6. **Ensures Transactional Integrity**: Guarantees ACID properties for database changes.

SQL's versatility and standardization make it indispensable for managing relational databases in web applications.
